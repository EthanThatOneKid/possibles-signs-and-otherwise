### About the owner

> I'm Jacob Fosdick, the owner of Possibles | Signs and Otherwise. I grew up
> skateboarding in Garden Grove, CA where I unknowingly started my career in the
> sign industry. I spent a lot of time in the family shop building ramps and
> hand cutting stencils to spray paint on my skateboards. At 18 years old I was
> hired on at a sign shop where I realized I could continue to do what I was
> doing in my free time and actually make a living doing it. 15 years later and
> I'm still in the shop doing what I've always enjoyedâ€¦ finding ways to create
> something.
